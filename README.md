Car classification is a crucial task in the automotive industry. With the increasing number of car manufacturers, it has become challenging to classify cars based on various parameters. We will explore various machine learning models to classify cars based on their parameters. 

This will be our approach to build the machine learning model. 
- Importing the required packages into our python environment
- Importing the car class dataset to perform EDA on it 
- Cleaning the dataset for further processing 
- Feature selection and data split 
- Implementing machine learning models using algorithms 
- Evaluating the model using the necessary evaluation metrics 

Here is the confusion matric obtained at the end
